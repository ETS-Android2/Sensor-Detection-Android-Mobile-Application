# Sensor-Detection-Android-Mobile-Application

### Application Activity
<p align = "justify">
Explore Sensors Android app which has: <br/>
1) Collect sensor data from the following sensors: a) accelerometer, b) linear-acceleration, c) temperature, d) light, e) GPS, and f) proximity. <br/>
2) Collect these data and store into a database using Room. Use separate tables for each sensor. The UI has a toggle switch for each of the sensors to start and stop collecting data any number of times.<br/>
3) The UI also has provisions (buttons) to get the past 1 hour average value of the accelerometer (for all three axis separately) and temperature sensor.  <br/>
4) If the user wants to see the average values, it should be showcased as part of the UI using a text view. <br/>
5) Now using only the accelerometer sensor data identify if the device is stationary or in motion. <br/>
